************METHOD REFERENCES
  ==>Method reference can be seen as shorthand for lambdas calling only a specific method. the basic idea is that if a lambda represents
        "call this method directly", it is best to refer to the method by name rather than by a description of how to call it
   ==> when you need a method reference, the target reference is placed before the delimiter :: and the name of the method is provided after it


=======RULES======
==> A method reference to a static method(for example, the method parselnt of integer, written Integer::parseInt)
==> A method reference to an instance method of an arbitrary type  (for example, the method length of a string , written String ::length)
==>A method reference to an instance method of an existence object or expression (for example, suppose you have a local variable expensiveTransaction that
      holds an object of type Transaction , which supports an instance method getValue; you can write expensiveTransacation:: getValue)
