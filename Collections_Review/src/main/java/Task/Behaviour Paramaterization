Behaviour parameterization ==> is a software development pattern that lets you handle frequent requirement change
==> it means taking a block of code and making it available without executing. this block of code can be called later by other parts of your programs
==>you can pass the block of code as an argument to other method that will execute later
   == the ability to tell a method to take multiple behaviour


  **** HOW IT WORKS   ********
   1=> create interface(is giving an option to create a method with out implementation)
   2=>create the class to implementing the interface
   3=>create the object from the implementation class and give a behaviour(method)

   The main objective of enum is to define our own data types(Enumerated Data Types).
   Declaration of enum in Java: Enum declaration can be done outside a Class or inside a Class but not inside a Method.
