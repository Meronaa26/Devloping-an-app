***********METHOD REFERENCES*******************

Method references can be seen as shorthand for lambdas calling only a
specific method. The basic idea is that if a lambda represents “call this method
directly”, it is best to refer to the method by name rather than by a description
of how to call it.
When you need a method reference, the target reference is placed before the
delimiter :: and the name of the method is provided after it.




A Method reference to a static method (for example, the method parseInt of
Integer, written Integer :: parseInt)

A Method reference to an instance method of an arbitrary type (for example,
the method length of a String, written String :: length)

A method reference to an instance method of an existence object or expression
(for example, suppose you have a local variable expensiveTransaction that
holds an object of type Transaction, which supports an instance method
getValue; you can write expensiveTransaction :: getValue)
